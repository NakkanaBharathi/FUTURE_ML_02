# Customer Churn Prediction

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Customer Churn Prediction model** that helps identify customers who are likely to stop using a company's service. Predicting churn in advance enables businesses to take preventive measures and improve customer retention.

##  Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the key challenges faced by businesses. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques that can classify whether a customer is likely to churn or not, based on various features such as demographics, account details, and service usage patterns.

This project was implemented in **Google Colab** using Python and various data science libraries.
